    <p class="history">Kerala's Jatayu Nature Park is inspired by the story of Jatayu, a mythical character in the
        Ramayana, one
        of the Indian epics.<br>
        You will certainly get mesmerised with Kollam’s latest tourist attraction, the Jatayu Earth’s Center that hosts
        the world’s largest bird sculpture. <br>Spanning over 65 acres across four hills, this is the State’s first ever
        BOT
        (Build-Operate-Transfer) tourism.<br>

        The monumental statue of Jatayu resting high up the hill catches your attention even from afar on your way to
        Chadayamangalam in Kollam district. Jatayu is a legendary bird from the Indian epic Ramayana.<br>

        You can reach the hilltop using a cable car. A multitude of experiences await the traveller in Jatayu Rock. One
        such
        is the museum and the 6D theatre inside the sculpture. You can even have a hele-taxi experience from here!

        All adventure junkies, this is your perfect weekend getaway! Engage in adventurous games in the backdrop of
        breathtaking views of nature. Whether it be Burma bridges, commando nets, log walk, vertical ladder, chimney
        climbing or side joola, choose your pick and let the adrenaline rush through the body.<br>

        Now what adds to the thrill is the Paintball zone!<br>

        Besides all these exclusive experiences, the place also has provision for Ayurveda, camping, trekking, live
        kitchen
        and a lot more to make your trip splendid.<br></p>
