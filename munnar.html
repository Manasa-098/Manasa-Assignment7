        God's Own Country, Kerala, is not very far behind in being host to popular summer holiday destinations in
        India....Munnar is a town and hill station in the Idukki district of the southwestern Indian state of
        Kerala.<br>
        Munnar is situated at around 1,600 metres (5,200 ft) above mean sea level, in the Western Ghats mountain range.
        Munnar is also called the "Kashmir of South India" and is a popular honeymoon destination.
    </p>
    <h1>Etymology</h1>
    The name Munnar is believed to mean "three rivers", referring to its location at the confluence of the
    Mudhirapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundali rivers.
    The region has been inhabited by hunter-gatherer tribals like the Malayarayan and Muthuvan for thousands of
    years.[7] Tradition states that Colonel Arthur Wellesley, later the Duke of Wellington, was the first British person
    to pass through Munnar during Tippu Sultan's campaign in Travancore, but this is unsubstantiated. The first survey
    of the terrain was undertaken by Benjamin Swayne Ward in 1816â€“1817, who followed the Periyar into the Western Ghats
    and established a camp at the confluence of three rivers, from which the name of Munnar is derived.<br>

    <p>It was to be nearly 50 years later that Sir Charles Trevelyan, Governor of Madras, instructed Col. Douglas
        Hamilton
        to explore the hill country in the western part of the Madras Presidency, requesting special advice on the
        feasibility of establishing sanatoria for the British in the South and of developing revenue- earning projects
        without endangering the environment, as had happened in Ceylon where coffee had destroyed not only the rain
        forest
        but also paddy cultivation in the north-central rice bowl of ancient Ceylon. Hamilton climbed throughout the
        Ghats
        in Munnar region. 15 years later, John Daniel Munro noted that much of Munnar's land was suitable for coffee
        plantations. Munro, Henry Turn and his half-brother AW Turner obtained ownership of the Cardamom Hills from the
        Raja
        of Travancore and began clearing forest around Devikulam in 1879. Soon many other Europeans began establishing
        tea
        plantations in the area throughout the 1880s. Early plantations had few facilities and were mainly huts of
        straw.<br>
    </p>

    Eventually roads were opened to the lowlands and in Bodinayakanur in western Madras Presidency, planters got
    provisions from a local headman - Suppan Chetty. He and his son, Alaganan Chetty (later an MLA) would continue
    providing supplies to the tea estates in the region. By 1894, 26 estates were established in the hills but all were
    facing losses. In 1897, a separate company, Kannan Devan Hills Corporation (KDHC) was registered to operate the tea
    estates which was later taken over by the American Direct Tea Trading Company Ltd., who owned 26 estates, most with
    coffee and some with cinchona, almost all in the area except for a few in the lower areas.<br>

    In 1900, a ropeway was built and eventually monorails were installed for easier transport of goods to the plains. In
    1901, P. R. Buchanan took over as General Manager and began the most extensive clearing of jungles for plantations.
    In 1908, construction started on a new railway which opened in 1909. By 1911, around 16,000 acres of the region was
    under cultivation.<br>
    <pre></pre>

    In 1924, a flood swept through Munnar, damaged the road and destroyed the rail track. In its place it was decided to
    create a ropeway to transport tea. In 1930, this in turn was replaced by a modern road that made transport much
    easier. By 1952, almost 28,000 acres of land was under cultivation. After Independence, Indian planters took over.
    In 1964, the KDHC which owned most tea estates was acquired by Tata and Finlay who started the first instant tea
    factory in the country. In 1971, the Kerala government wanted to reforest all land in the hills not used for
    plantations. However negotiations that followed resulted in Tata keeping most of the land, leaving it with 57,000
    acres.<br>
    <pre></pre>

    To this day, most tea estate labourers are landless. In the early 2000s, the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, a Dalit
    outfit from Tamil Nadu, started demanding land for the labourers, started making inroads into Kerala. In 2009, VS
    Achuthanandan promised his support for providing land to the mainly Tamil Dalit estate labourers. However, the
    process became very slow and as of 2018, most families still hand no land.<br>

    The former Kunda Valley Railway in Munnar was destroyed by a flood in 1924, but tourism officials are considering
    reconstructing the railway line to attract tourists.<br>
