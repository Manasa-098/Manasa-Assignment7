        the
        writer of Ramayana.[10][11] As per the Ramayana, Sita gave birth to Lava and Kusha, sons of lord
        Rama at
        Ramtirath ashram. Numerous people visit Ramtirath Temple at the annual fair. The nearby cities
        Lahore
        and
        Kasur
        were believed to be founded by Lava and Kusha, respectively. It is believed that during Ashvamedha
        Yajna
        by
        Lord
        Rama, Lava and Kush caught the ritual horse and tied Lord Hanuman to a tree near to today's Durgiana

    <h1>History</h1>
    <div class="cls1">
        <img src="img2.jpg" alt="" class="img">
        <span>In the Sikh tradition, Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh
            guru,
            is
            credited
            with
            founding the holy city of Amritsar. Two versions of stories exist regarding the land where Guru
            Ram
            Das
            ji
            settled.
            In one, based on a Gazetteer record, the land was purchased, with Sikh donations, for 700 rupees
            from
            the
            owners
            of
            the village of Tung.<br>
            <pre></pre>

            According to historical Sikh records, the site was chosen by Guru Amar Das and called Guru Da
            Chakk.
            The
            latter
            guru
            had asked Ram Das to find land to start a new town, and to create a man-made pool as its central
            point.
            After
            the
            coronation Guru Ram Das ji in 1574, who faced hostile opposition from the sons of Guru Amar Das,
            he
            founded
            the
            town; it was named after him as "Ramdaspur". He first completed the pool, and built his new
            official
            Guru
            centre
            and
            home next to it. He invited merchants and artisans from other parts of India to settle into the
            new
            town
            with
            him.
            The town expanded during the time of Guru Arjan Dev ji, financed by donations and constructed by
            volunteers.
            town
            grew to become the city of Amritsar. After the son of Guru Amar Das built the gurdwara Harmandir
            Sahib,
            the
            pool
            area developed further as a temple complex. In 1604 Amar Das's son installed the scripture of
            Sikhism
            inside
            the
            new
            temple.<br>
            <pre></pre>

            The period and achievements of construction between 1574 and 1604 are described in Mahima
            Prakash
            Vartak, a
            semi-historical Sikh hagiographic text likely composed in 1741. It is the earliest known
            document
            dealing
            with
            the
            lives of all the ten Gurus.
