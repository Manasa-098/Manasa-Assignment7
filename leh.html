    <p>Leh was for centuries an important stopover on trade routes along the Indus Valley between Tibet, Kashmir, India
        and China. The main goods carried were salt, grain, pashm or cashmere wool, charas or cannabis resin from the
        Tarim Basin, indigo, silk yarn and Banaras brocade.

    Although there are a few indications that the Chinese knew of a trade route through Ladakh to India as early as the
    Kushan period (1st to 3rd centuries CE), and certainly by the Tang dynasty,little is actually known of the
    history of the region before the end of the 10th century, when Tibetan prince Skyid lde nyima gon (or Nyima gon), a
    grandson of the anti-Buddhist Tibetan king, Langdarma (r. c. 838 to 841), founded the kingdom. He conquered Western
    Tibet, although his army originally numbered only 300 men.[citation needed] Several towns and castles are said to
    have been founded by Nyima gon, and he apparently ordered the construction of the primary sculptures at Shey. "In an
    inscription, he says he had them made for the religious benefit of the Tsanpo (the dynastical name of his father and
    ancestors), and of all the people of Ngaris (Western Tibet). This shows that already in this generation Langdarma's
    opposition to Buddhism had disappeared." Shey, 15 km east of modern Leh, was the ancient seat of the Ladakhi
    kings.

    During the reign of Delegs Namgyal (1660–1685),[9] the nawab of Kashmir, then a province in the Mughal Empire,
    arranged for the Mongol army to temporarily leave Ladakh, though it returned later. As payment for assisting Delegs
    Namgyal in the Tibet-Ladakh-Mughal War of 1679–1684, the nawab made a number of onerous demands. One of the least
    was construction of a large Sunni Muslim mosque in Leh, at the upper end of the bazaar in Leh below Leh Palace. The
    mosque reflects a mixture of Islamic and Tibetan architecture and can accommodate more than 500 people. This was
    apparently not the first mosque in Leh; there are two smaller ones that are said to be older.

    Trade routes have traditionally converged on Leh from all four directions. The modern highway follows the most
    direct route from the Punjab via Mandi, the Kulu valley, the Rohtang Pass, and Lahaul to the Indus Valley, then
    downriver to Leh. The route from Srinagar was roughly the same as the road that today crosses the Zoji La (pass) to
    Kargil, then up the Indus Valley to Leh. From Baltistan there were two difficult routes: the main one ran up the
    Shyok Valley from the Indus, over a pass and then down the Hanu River to the Indus again below Khalsi (Khalatse).
    The other ran from Skardu straight up the Indus to Kargil and on to Leh. Both summer and winter routes ran from Leh
    to Yarkand via the Karakoram Pass and Xaidulla. A couple of possible routes also ran from Leh to Lhasa.

    The first recorded royal residence in Ladakh, built at the top of the high Namgyal ('Victory') Peak overlooking the
    present palace and town, is the now-ruined fort and gon-khang (Temple of the Guardian Divinities) built by King
    Tashi Namgyal. Tashi Namgyal ruled in the final quarter of the 16th century CE. The Namgyal also called "Tsemo
    Gompa" (Red Gompa), or dGon-pa-so-ma (New Monastery), a temple, is the main Buddhist centre in Leh.There
    are some older walls of fortifications behind it which Francke reported were once known as the "Dard Castle." If it
    was indeed built by Dards, it must pre-date the establishment of Tibetan rulers in Ladakh over a thousand years ago.

            <h1>Leh Palace (Old palace of the kings in Leh.)</h1>


            The royal palace, known as Leh Palace, was built by King Sengge Namgyal (1612–1642),[17] presumably between
            the period when the Portuguese Jesuit priest Francisco de Azevedo visited Leh in 1631, and made no mention
            of it, and Sengge Namgyal's death in 1642.
            <pre></pre>

            The Leh Palace is nine storeys high; the upper floors accommodated the royal family, and the stables and
            storerooms are located on the lower floors. The palace was abandoned when Kashmiri forces besieged it in the
            mid-19th century. The royal family moved their premises south to their current home in Stok Palace on the
            southern bank of the Indus River.
            <pre></pre>

            As has already been mentioned, the original name of the town was not sLel, as it is nowadays spelled, but
            sLes, which signifies an "encampment of nomads". These [Tibetan] nomads probably visited the Leh valley at
            when it began to be irrigated by Dard colonisers. The most ancient part of the ruins, atop
            rNam-rgyal-rtse-mo hill, are called 'aBrog-pal-mkhar (Dard castle)
